# Calisthenics Conventions

### Repetition Range for various exercises

## Progression

An athlete adhering this convention shall:

- Use the "Repetition Addition" method (except for pulling exercises, see below).
  > Repetition Addition: […] aims to increase the repetitions in all […] sets over a period of a week or two. […] If you cannot improve all of your repetitions in every set, using this method is one way to bridge the gap.
- Consider the exercsises individually to gauge progress.
- Note if adding a repetition to a certain exercise is impossible and in this case deload in the next workout by subtracting two repetitions from each of the sets of the last week. In the subsequent workout, this reduction is reversed.
- On Steven Low's advice, use the "Additional Set" method for pulling exercises.
  
  In the interpretation of the method used here, a sequence looks like this: `3x5, 4x5, 5x5, 6x5, 3x6, ...` or rather `3x5, 3x5+3, 3x5+4, 4x5, ... 3x6 ...`
  
  For exercises that are performed using the "Additional Set" method and that exceed the time required for circuit training, the usual time period applies. In addition, a pause of the same duration is granted.

## Heat

An athlete adhering to this convention shall:

- take a bath for at least 3 minutes at the minimum temperature provided by the tap if the temperature exceeds 29°C.
  
    >  acute heat exposure is detrimental to muscular endurance

    > Subjects' muscular endurance decreased significantly (p < 0.05)

    > El Helou et al.’s data also show that the body’s response to increasingly hotter temperatures is non-linear, meaning your performance will get vastly worse moving from 21°C to 31°C as compared to 12°C and 21°C.

    > Although El Helou et al. found that dew point had weak association with performance levels, many runners find it very helpful to adjust expectations for running performance based on dew point. Dew point is often considered a more accurate way of measuring the humidity and comfort of air, which for runners, makes a big difference.

    > Once you have found the dew point, use this as a guide to running safely and effectively in high heat and humidity.

    > Below 12°C … 0%
    > 
    > 13°C to 15°C … 1%
    > 
    > 16°C to 18°C … 2-3%
    > 
    > 18°C to 21°C … 3-5%
    > 
    > 21°C to 23°C … 5-8%
    > 
    > 23°C to 25°C … 12-15%

    > 25°C
