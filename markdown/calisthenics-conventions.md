# Calisthenics Conventions

> _The best program is the one you stick to._

## Repetition Range

In "Overcoming Gravity" 2nd edition (henceforth: OG), Steven Low advises "Trained Beginners" to

> place an emphasis on training in the five to fifteen repetition range, in order to ensure good muscular development and strength. [OG, p.24]

Following this suggestion an athlete adhering to this convention shall progress if they can at least do three sets of fifteen repetitions in one workout.

## Progression

An athlete adhering this convention shall:

- Use the "Repetition Addition" method (except for pulling exercises, see below).

  > Repetition Addition: […] aims to increase the repetitions in all […] sets over a period of a week or two. […] If you cannot improve all of your repetitions in every set, using this method is one way to bridge the gap. [OG p.??]

  A sequence here might look like `3+3+3, 3+4+3, 3+4+4, 4+4+4`.

- Consider the exercsises individually to gauge progress.
- Note if adding a repetition to a certain exercise is impossible and in this case deload in the next workout by subtracting two repetitions from each of the sets of the last week. In the subsequent workout, this reduction is reversed.
- Following Steven Low's advice, use the "Additional Set" method for pulling exercises.

  In the interpretation of the method used here, a sequence looks like this: `3x5, 4x5, 5x5, 6x5, 3x6, ...` or rather `3x5, 3x5+3, 3x5+4, 4x5, ... 3x6 ...`

  For exercises that are performed using the "Additional Set" method and that exceed the time required for circuit training, the usual time period applies. In addition, a pause of the same duration is granted.

## Heat

- > Acute heat exposure is detrimental to muscular endurance [[Hedley](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12173948)]

- > The body’s response to increasingly hotter temperatures is non-linear, meaning your performance will get vastly worse moving from 21°C to 31°C as compared to 12°C and 21°C" [[RunnersConnect.net](https://runnersconnect.net/dew-point-effect-running/https://runnersconnect.net/dew-point-effect-running/)].

Therefore, an athlete adhering to this convention shall take a bath for at least three minutes at the minimum temperature provided by the tap if the temperature exceeds 29°C before and after they train.
