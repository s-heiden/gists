This file specifies how I want to manage my belongings. It clarifies the questions of when to purchase items, how to store them, and how to dispose of them.


## Physical Record Collection

- Buy only records that mean something special to you and don't buy them to complete a discography.


## Digital Record Collection

- Obtain records to complete discographies of certain treasured artists. Delete recordings you never listen to and whose creators are not special to you.
- The discography of an artist shall
  - comprise the tracks published by them
  - comprise their tracks that are unpublished (radio shows, bootlegs)
  - not contain tracks of other artists relating to the artist in question
  - not contain tracks in which the artist in question has merely participated
