### Arriving at your seat

- When you arrive at your seat, face the seat and bow in gassho.
- Then, turn around to the right until your seat is behind you, and bow again.
- Turn around to the right.
- Sit down on your zafu, and sit facing the wall.

  solidly on your sit bones. Lengthen/stretch the buttocks back with your hands, and then
  straighten up.
- Place your hands palms-up on your knees and sway the upper half of your body from left to right a few times.
- When the bell is rung twice at the end of a period of zazen, bow in gassho

- Unfold your legs.
- Stand up slowly, plump up the sitting cushions and move the zafo to the wall.
- Turn clockwise.
- Bow in Gassho into the room.

### Kinhin

- Hold your hands in shashu, stand straight and steady your breath for a moment.
- Then begin to do kinhin. Advance by taking only half a step for each full breath (one exhalation and inhalation).
- When kinhin is finished, the bell will be rung once. Align your feet and bow, with your hands still held in shashu.
- Then, return to your seat at a normal pace.
