# Calisthenics Conventions

> _The best program is the one you stick to._

## Repetition Range

In "Overcoming Gravity" 2nd edition (henceforth: OG), Steven Low advises "Trained Beginners" to

> place an emphasis on training in the five to fifteen repetition range, in order to ensure good muscular development and strength. [OG, p.24]

Following this suggestion an athlete adhering to this convention shall progress if they can at least do three sets of fifteen repetitions in one workout.

## Workout Structure

Since it has proven simple and effective, workouts are structured as **circuit**. 
As a rule, a time period of 2 minutes (henceforth: **round**) is allowed for each individual set.

### Special Case Adjacent Sets Involving Same Muscle Group

In general, one round is allowed for each exercise no matter which method it is trained with.

Multiplying the duration of a round by the number of sets by the number of exercises results in a **minimum workout core time**, for example 2 minutes x 3 sets x 4 exercises = 24 minutes. Due to the "Adding Sets" method, sets of certain exercises can exceed this core time.

In this case, two rounds that involve the same muscle group may follow each other directly. To prevent this, an additional idle round will be allowed between two exercises involving the same muscle group.

### Special Case Unilateral Exercises

By definition, unilateral exercises such as the [Pistol Squat](https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/BWSingleLegSquat) or the [Kettlebell Press](https://exrx.net/WeightExercises/Kettlebell/KBPress) can be divided into a left hand version as well as a right hand version. During training both versions are understood as forming a unit.

As a rule, all repetitions of this unit are executed within one set. This can be achieved in two ways:

- alternatingly: one repetition of the left hand version, one repetition of the right hand version, and so on
- sequentially: all repetitions of the left hand version followed by all repetitions of the right hand version

As both versions are understood as forming a unit, all repetitions of both versions are carried out within one round. You will notice that this doubles the total number of repetitions within one round. To counteract this, an additional idle round is allowed after a set consisting of more than 7.5 repetitions (ie. half the upper limit of the repetition range) of each of the versions.

In any case, the amount of repetitions of the side with the smaller number of repetitions is logged.

## The Microcycle

As has been practiced for years, three days of workouts are followed by one or two days of rest.

## Progression

An athlete adhering this convention shall:

- Use the "Repetition Addition" method (except for pulling exercises, see below).

  > Repetition Addition: […] aims to increase the repetitions in all […] sets over a period of a week or two. […] If you cannot improve all of your repetitions in every set, using this method is one way to bridge the gap. [OG p.??]

  A sequence of workouts here might look like `3, 3, 3`, `3, 4, 3`, `4, 4, 3`, and finally `4, 4, 4`.

- Following Steven Low's advice, use the "Additional Set" method for pulling exercises.

  In the interpretation of the method used here, a sequence looks like this: `3x5`, `4x5`, `5x5`, `6x5`, `3x6`, or more realistically `3x5`, `3x5, 3`, `3x5, 4`, `4x5`, ... `3x6`.

## Deloading

Let **inter-workout progress** be understood as increasing difficulty or volume with regard to one exercise in comparison to the previous workout.

If no inter-workout progress can be achieved, this is documented. In the following workout, the volume of the exercise in question is reduced according to the following scheme:

- "Repetition Addition" method: Reduction by 2 repetitions for all sets based on the worse result of the last two workouts, eg. after `7, 7, 6` and `7, 6, 5`, a volume of `5, 4, 3` or rather `3x4` is aimed at.
- "Adding Sets" method: Reduction to the number of sets successfully completed in the worse of the last two workouts, eg. after `5x7`, and `3x7, 4`, a volume of `3x7` is aimed at. 

In the subsequent workout, this reduction is reversed.

## Heat

- > Acute heat exposure is detrimental to muscular endurance [[Hedley](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12173948)]

- > The body’s response to increasingly hotter temperatures is non-linear, meaning your performance will get vastly worse moving from 21°C to 31°C as compared to 12°C and 21°C" [[RunnersConnect.net](https://runnersconnect.net/dew-point-effect-running/https://runnersconnect.net/dew-point-effect-running/)].

This circumstance is taken into account by accepting a reduction in performance on particularly hot days.
